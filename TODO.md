## TODO's

- Finish documentation!!!
- Write soft labels for the `normal` and `extend` modules.
- Revisit `form` and `menu` modules with regards to set defaults with `Option<FORM>` and `Option<MENU>`, see NCurses documention.
- Need an example for the `form` module.
- Need an example of screen functionality using stdin and stdout and also xterm sessions (the crate `nix` has a `openpty()` routine).
- Do we need examples of individual routines? I think not!
